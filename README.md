# crud-app

- This is basic CRUD implementing app i.e this app will perform some normal task that are the fundamentals of any website or webapp.
- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete which are the basic methods that we encounter in full-stack development.

## MVC model
- This app will follow MVC model i.e Model View controller.
- Model : the part of our application that will deal with the database or any data-related functionality.
- View : everything the user will see — basically, the pages that we’re going to send to the client.
- Controller: the logic of our site, and the bridge between models and views. Here we call our models to get the data, then we put that data on our views to be sent to the users.
